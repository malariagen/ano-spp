# Plasmodium rebalancing third experiment, version 3

Samples: An. stephensi were fed with a P. falciparum gametocyte culture, and two feed experiments were included - feed15, which had a prevalence of 60% and an average oocyst intensity of 5 per gut; and feed16, which had a prevalence of 95% and an average oocyst intensity of 18 per gut. As before, 8 control uninfected mosquitoes were included. Feed 15 was sampled at days 0, 8, and 13/14 and Feed 16 was sampled at day 0 and 9. Each time point included 16 individual mosquitoes for a total of 88 samples.

Several conditions were tested. Sample name example `8010_51_e1_f15_un1`:
- 8010/805 - Anopheles panel + 80x P1/10x P2 or 80x P1/5x P2
- 51/55 - PCR1 temperature
- e1/e2 - non-destructive or subsequent destructive (grinding with beads) extraction with buffer C 
- feed 15/16
- uninfected, sample 1
