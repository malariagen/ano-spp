# Plasmodium rebalancing third experiment, version 2

Samples: An. stephensi were fed with a P. falciparum gametocyte culture, and two feed experiments were included - feed15, which had a prevalence of 60% and an average oocyst intensity of 5 per gut; and feed16, which had a prevalence of 95% and an average oocyst intensity of 18 per gut. As before, 8 control uninfected mosquitoes were included. Feed 15 was sampled at days 0, 8, and 13/14 and Feed 16 was sampled at day 0 and 9. Each time point included 16 individual mosquitoes for a total of 88 samples.

Upon previous run, a set of different conditions were tested. Sample naming example 8010_e1_f15_1d_8:

- panel used:
  - 8010 - Anopheles panel + 80x P1/10x P2
  - 805 - Anopheles panel + 80x P1/5x P2
  - ano - Anopheles panel only
  - plas - P1/P2 primers only
  - grc1 - Falciparum GRC1
  - grc2 - Falciparum GRC2
- extraction e1/e2 - non-destructive or subsequent destructive extraction with buffer C
- feed f15/f16
- day 1, sample 8 within day

For tagging, plates were iterated as follows: extractions - within plate; 1/2 - plate 10/11; 1-2/3-4/5-6/7-8/9-10/11-12 - panels. This is the highest number of samples tested to date.
