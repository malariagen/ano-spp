# Plasmodium rebalancing second experiment

15 pools represented various combinations of P1 and P2 concentrations relative to default (300pM): 10x, 20x, 40x, 80x, 160x P1 and 10x (pools 1-5), 20x (pools 6-10), 40x (pools 11-15) P2. Pool 16 had no P1/P2.

Samples:
- Serial dilutions of P. falciparum (50 fg/µl - 5 ag/µl in steps of 10x) with An. stephensi (0.747 ng/µl) or An. coluzzii (1.238 ng/µl) DNA were made - approximate ratios of 1:10,000 to 1:100,000,000
- 40 lab-infected mosquitoes: An. stephensi were fed with a P. falciparum gametocyte culture and sampled at 0 hours, 24 hours, 3 days and 9 days after feed. Unfed mosquitoes were used as control and 8 specimens were included for each time point, including controls.
- 3 samples from South America extracted two times with buffer C: initial non-desctructive & subsequent destructive. Plasmodium primer concentrations unclear

Sample IDs:
- SAm samples include four-letter species id, sample id and extraction suffix, `-1` or `-2`
- all remaining samples have pool number as prefix, e.g. '1_'
- Plasmodium dilutions indicate mosquito species (`ps` or `pc`) and dilution (`10e4`-`10e8`). Example: `1_pc10e7`.
- infected mosquitoes include a combination of sampling point (`un`,`0d`,`1d`,`3d`,`9d`) and internal sample number (1-8). Example: `16_9d3`.
